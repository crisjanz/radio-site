## 🖼️ **Admin Image Editor Tool - Implementation Plan**

### Overview
Building a comprehensive admin tool for downloading, editing, and managing station favicon images using Fabric.js with local server storage to simplify favicon handling across the application.

### Backend Implementation

#### 1. Create Image Management Routes (`/Users/cristianjanz/radio-back/src/routes/images.ts`)
- **Download endpoint**: `POST /images/download/:stationId` - Downloads original favicon and stores locally
- **Upload endpoint**: `POST /images/upload/:stationId` - Accepts edited image and updates database
- **List broken favicons**: `GET /images/broken` - Returns stations with non-working favicon URLs
- **Batch download**: `POST /images/batch-download` - Downloads multiple favicons at once

#### 2. Create Public Images Directory
- Create `/Users/cristianjanz/radio-back/public/station-images/` directory
- Serve static files from this directory via Express
- Store images as `{stationId}.png` or `{stationId}.jpg`

#### 3. Update Database Schema (if needed)
- Add `localImagePath` field to Station model to track locally stored images
- Update favicon URLs to point to local images after editing

### Frontend Implementation

#### 1. Create Image Editor Page (`/Users/cristianjanz/radio-site/src/pages/ImageEditorPage.tsx`)
- **Station selector**: Dropdown or search to select station
- **Image preview**: Show current favicon with download status
- **Fabric.js canvas**: Interactive editor for image manipulation
- **Save controls**: Save to database and update favicon URL

#### 2. Add to Admin Navigation
- Add "Image Editor" link to existing AdminPage
- Route setup in main app routing

#### 3. Fabric.js Editor Features
- **Canvas setup**: Responsive canvas with Fabric.js
- **Load image**: Load downloaded favicon into canvas
- **Make square**: Crop or pad to square aspect ratio
- **Background colors**: Color picker for background
- **Borders**: Add colored borders with thickness control
- **Resize**: Standard sizes (64x64, 128x128, 256x256)
- **Export**: Export as PNG with optimized quality

#### 4. Batch Processing Interface
- **Station list**: Show all stations with favicon status
- **Bulk actions**: Select multiple stations for batch download
- **Progress tracking**: Show download/processing progress
- **Fix broken URLs**: Automatically try HTTP→HTTPS conversion

### File Structure
```
radio-back/
├── src/routes/images.ts (new)
├── public/station-images/ (new directory)
└── package.json (add: multer, sharp for image processing)

radio-site/
├── src/pages/ImageEditorPage.tsx (new)
├── src/components/ImageEditor.tsx (new)
└── package.json (add: fabric)
```

### Implementation Steps
1. **Backend**: Create image routes and storage setup
2. **Frontend**: Install Fabric.js and create basic editor interface  
3. **Integration**: Connect editor to backend APIs
4. **Batch features**: Add bulk processing capabilities
5. **Testing**: Test with various image types and sizes

### Dependencies to Add
- **Backend**: `multer` (file uploads), `sharp` (image processing)
- **Frontend**: `fabric` (image editor), `@types/fabric` (TypeScript types)

### Problem Being Solved
- **Current Issue**: Complex client-side favicon fallback logic causing delays and broken images
- **Solution**: Download and standardize all favicons server-side, use simple direct URLs
- **Benefits**: Faster loading, consistent image sizes, professional appearance, better user experience

This approach gives you full control over favicon images with professional editing capabilities while keeping everything simple and maintainable.

## 🔧 **Admin System Architecture (MAJOR SHIFT)**

### Overview
Moving from React-based admin (in frontend) to HTML-based admin (in backend) for better simplicity, direct database access, and elimination of CORS issues with file uploads and image management.

### 🏗️ **New Architecture Decision**

#### **From: React Admin (Being Phased Out)**
- **Location**: `/Users/cristianjanz/streemr/radio-site/src/pages/AdminPage.tsx`
- **Issues**: 
  - CORS complications with file uploads
  - Complex API calls for image management
  - Separation of concerns between frontend/backend
  - Additional authentication/authorization complexity

```sql
Station Model (Extended):
- metadataApiUrl: String?     -- API endpoint URL
- metadataApiType: String?    -- Type (laut.fm, custom, website, etc.)
- metadataFormat: String?     -- Response format (json, text)
- metadataFields: String?     -- JSON field mappings
```

#### **API Endpoints**
- `GET /metadata/database-stats` - Coverage statistics
- `POST /metadata/test-station` - Test single station
- `POST /metadata/save-config` - Save working configuration
- `GET /metadata/stations-with-metadata` - List configured stations

### 💡 **Next Steps for Metadata Expansion**
1. **Bulk testing**: Run batch tests on all 582 stations to find working sources
2. **Pattern enhancement**: Add more platform-specific detection patterns
3. **User experience**: Add song change notifications and listening history
4. **Rich metadata**: Integrate album artwork and additional track information
5. **Performance**: Optimize polling intervals based on station update frequency

The metadata system is fully functional and ready for expansion to provide "Now Playing" information across your entire station catalog!
